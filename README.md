# archarmrpi5

Simple script to make Arch linux ARM bootable on RaspberryPI 5

### How to use

1. Clone repo
2. Check last version of [this package](https://archlinuxarm.org/packages/aarch64/linux-rpi). If needed, change `LINUX_RPI_VER` value to package version in `build.sh`
3. Run `build.sh`, enter storage device and wait for script to finish
4. Insert storage device into RPI5. When booting for first time, system should reboot after ~10 seconds. After that you can fully use Arch ARM
5. Have fun!
